Epilogue:

Having helped <CHARNAME> in the final confrontation between <HIMHER> and Amelissan, Sir Wallace had returned to the mortal plane content knowing that he had helped his <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> in making their last decision regarding the matter. After parting ways from <HIMHER> and the rest of the party, Sir Wallace did what any pumpkin of his nature would do. Drink tankards empty and flirt with lasses across the entirety of the sword coast. Having his battles and tales told only bolstered the rowdy festivities he would make as he visited every inn and tavern in every town, big or small, he would come across in the name of both Sune and Chauntea while also ensuring no pumpkin gets eaten under his gaze. 

This all came to a stop one day as he realized that he was still missing something and as more tendays would pass it would all become unbearable to his orange hardened heart. Sir Wallace returned to the farm where he was once born only to find that the farm had transformed into a temple devoted to the gods he had worshipped. Once farmhands now turned followers along with many pilgrims that had traveled to witness the birthplace of the pumpkin defender had celebrated his return and soon his worries melted away as he rejoined his family. This, however did not stop his biggest surprise.

During one of the many celebrations thrown in his name, Sir Wallace was brought by Fred to see a dryad whose beauty won his heart within seconds. Fred had explained that his tales traveled so far that even the Dryad Fairy Queen Vaelasa had told his tale to her people and was given word from her to bring the dryad here. Within seconds the two were married and all were invited to see. After finishing his vows, some swore that the sunlight brought  visions of Sune and Chauntea, blessing his life with many children and eternal happiness.
